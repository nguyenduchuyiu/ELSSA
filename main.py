I can tell Rosé had pressured to be this “perfect” image of an idol, especially a YG idol in korea. So the fact she’s growing (not only her but all four of the members) not only as an artist but as a person and her emotions she’s able to express to people is just a good feeling to hear and see. I’m really glad there’s people by rosie’s side that supported and pushed her.")
